Upon creating this blog, my intentions were to create a space where I could write down my raw thoughts, findings, what I'm currently reading and what I'm working on.
The general aim is for this an unfiltered, clean space for me to watch and learn how I and my thoughts progress over the years and for you, possibly, to observe how this happens.
